# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-Design

#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
-The problem that I was solving in the projects for the course was to find a fast and efficient way to sort information using data structures.
We ordered the courses in alphabetical order and the courses all had different data in nodes, which were the courseID, prerequisites and the Name.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?
-I approached the problem by taking it step by step and approaching any issues lightly at first and then studying more on that topic/ The data structures were very difficult for me to grasp but with more time I feel I can come closer to mastering data structures.
Data strucures are important to understand because they can improve the overall performance of a program and can have faster runtimes and efficiency.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
-I overcame any roadblocks by researching more and refering to zybooks about hashtables, linked lists and Binary Trees. When I had issues with activities I would ask alot of queestions to people that also know computer science and I also reffered to google and youtube!

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
-My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by making me realize that there is alot more to learn! It made me realize that there is always going to be a problem that you have not yet approached and that you must understand that it is okay to struggle, especially with a course as difficult as this for beginners. It also made me approach designing and developing programs with more patience, understanding and motivation.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-My work on the projects evolved the way I write programs that have readablilty, adaptability, and maintainability by teaching me to take my time on developing the program and trying to make it as understandable as possible because when you create something difficult, its always good to refer back to it and understand what you did and what problem you were solving. The more clean the code is, the more maintable and adaptable it could be as well since you will not have to spend much time trying to figure out what you must maintian and adapt too.
